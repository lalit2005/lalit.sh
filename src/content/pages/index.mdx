Welcome to the tiny collection of webpages that contains my thoughts and
projects. I am currently pursuing my undergraduate in computer science in Bits
Pilani, Goa campus, India.

From tinkering with compilers, interpreters and programming languages,
electronics and crafting blazing fast websites running on the edge and
everything in between brings me joy. I also love to build tools for thought.

I occasionaly write down some of my thoughts and about the projects that
I build. You can view them [here](/posts). I like building side-projects for fun and learning. You can view my
projects [here](/projects).

This page has [some of my achievements](/achievements). You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/lalit2005), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lalitcodes) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lalit2005/).
