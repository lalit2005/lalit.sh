This was my first offline hackathon. It was conducted by iNeuron in collaboration with GitHub.

I had to skip two exams to attend this hackathon! But it was definitely worth it.

This was probably my best day in my entire coding journey. It was filled with surprises and unexpected shout-outs
from great Youtube teachers like [Hitesh Choudhary](https://www.youtube.com/@HiteshChoudharydotcom), [Telusko's Naveen Reddy](https://www.youtube.com/@Telusko)
and many more.

I sleep a lot, but I never imagined even in my wildest dreams that I will be awake for 24hrs straight!!! Though I slept for 45 mins at around 3 am.
45 is the duration of each class, so it's naturally also my usual power nap duration ðŸ¤ª

Here are some clips from Youtube:

## Unexpected shoutout

Everything started from Hitesh Choudhary noticing me!

## The winning moment

I was not expecting any prize because other teams built really cool stuff like ML model that cloned Hitesh's voice to spanish
and restaurant management system with built-in real time chat - all in 24 hours!!
