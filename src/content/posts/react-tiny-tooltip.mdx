I built a small and lightweight react library for my projects sometime ago for creating beautiful and accessible tooltips in react - **React
Tiny Tooltip**. I'm happy to open source it now!

This short blog goes through briefly about this package.

## Using the library

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { Tooltip } from "react-tiny-tooltip";

export default () => (
  <div>
    <Tooltip content="Hello there" side="top">
      <button>Hover here!</button>
    </Tooltip>
  </div>
);
```

Here's how it would look

## Inspiration

I built a tooltip when I was building a project - [Paperclip](https://usepaperclip.now.sh). I liked the tooltips that I built in Paperclip and wanted to reuse it in all my [other projects](/projects), so I went ahead and created `react-tiny-tooltip`. I've used it in all my projects from then. But this repo was closed source from a long time. So I just found some free time this weekend to open source this. Hope you like it ‚úåÔ∏è

## Libraries used

List of all libraries used in creating this package

- [tsup](https://npm.im/tsup) for bundling code
- [Hyperdocs](https://hyperdocs.netlify.app/rtt) for creating docs (an other project by me ;))
- [Radix UI](https://radix-ui.com) for the unstyled tooltip component
- [Stitches](https://stitches.dev) for styling the tooltip
- [np](https://github.com/sindresorhus/np) for managing releases
- Typescript to provide type definitions for the package

I've purposefully limited the props that can be passed to the component so as to reduce the complexity.

The available props currently are `arrow`, `delay`, `side` and `sideOffset`.

## Building documentation

I used my own project [Hyperdocs](https://hyperdocs.netlify.app) for creating docs for this project. I'm biased but I was able to complete the docs in no time. All I did was added a bunch of markdown files and linked it with Hyperdocs. This process was much simple than what I had to do for my other project [StaticShield](https://staticshield.vercel.app) with [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app).

With Hyperdocs I was able to add add code previews right inside the docs for each prop. This helps you play with the library while reading the docs along side.

## React components as tooltip content

This is one of the main reason why I created this library. Most of the libraries only support rendering text in the tooltip. But `react-tiny-tooltip` can render any react fragment as tooltip content too!

Get started now by running

```bash
npm install react-tiny-tooltip
```
