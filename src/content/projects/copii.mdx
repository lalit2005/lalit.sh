This is my first project that I made without referring to any tutorial on YouTube. I made this for the [Vercel Hashnode Hackathon](https://townhall.hashnode.com/announcing-hashnode-hackathon-powered-by-vercel). This got me **second place in the hackathon**.

### The Problem it solves

When this project was made, GitHub READMEs had no way to copy code blocks. I wanted to make a copy button that would copy the code block to the clipboard.

[Here's the blog](/posts/copii) that goes through the complete process
of making Copii.
