Dot is a simple interpreted programming language written in go. It is a dynamically typed language with a syntax similar to python and javascript.

I built this to learn about how programming languages work and about interpreters and compilers.  
[_Writing an interpreter in go_](https://interpreterbook.com) is an amazing book by [Thorsten Ball](https://x.com/thorstenball) and I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning about interpreters and compilers.

I got inspired by Linus Lee's [Ink](https://thesephist.com/posts/pl/) programming language and decided to build my own language.

Some simple programs written in Dot:

```
// Hello World
print("Hello, World!");

// Fibonacci
let fib = fn (n) {
    if n <= 1 {
        return n;
    }
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
}
print(fib(10));

// Factorial
let fact = fn (n) {
    if n <= 1 {
        return 1;
    }
    return n * fact(n - 1);
}
print(fact(5));
```
