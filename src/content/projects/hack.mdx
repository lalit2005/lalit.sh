There was so much to learn about computers and how they work.
I wanted to learn about how a computer works from the ground up.
[Nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) opened up a whole new world and a lot of content made sense to me after completing this course

Here are links to different parts of a computer that I built as part of the course:

- [Logic gates](https://github.com/lalit2005/hack/tree/master/gates)
- [ALU](https://github.com/lalit2005/hack/tree/master/alu)
- [Memory](https://github.com/lalit2005/hack/tree/master/memory)
- [The Hack CPU](https://github.com/lalit2005/hack/tree/master/cpu)
- [Assembler](https://github.com/lalit2005/hack/tree/master/assembler)
- [VM Translator](https://github.com/lalit2005/hack/tree/master/vm)
- [Jack programming language](https://github.com/lalit2005/hack/tree/master/jack)

I highly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in learning about computers and how they work.
