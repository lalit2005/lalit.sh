## Highlights

Hyperdocs helps you create a documentation site for your project. It is a simple, yet powerful tool that can be used to create documentation for any project.

You will just need to add a `docs` folder with a bunch of markdown files. These will be used to generate a beautiful docs.

I believe this project has the best design amongst all the projects I have worked on.
