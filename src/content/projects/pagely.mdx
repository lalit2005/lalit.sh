## Highlights

This is one of the projects that I am really proud of. I had this idea from a very long time, but
the Clerk Hashnode Hackathon made me finish it in under a month. This also got me the runner up prize in the
hackathon.

Want a landing page for your next project? Want a jobs board? Want a blog? Want a portfolio? Want a faq page?
[Pagely](https://pagely.site/?rel=personalwebsite) is here to help you with that.

## Problem it solves

- Enables non-technical people/non-developers to build blazing fast websites from Notion.
- Much better than a regular public Notion page:
  - SEO friendly websites
  - Customizable styles and html tags
  - Automatic OG image generation
  - Password Protection
  - Ability to add analytics
  - Oof.. There are loads of other [features](https://lalit.vercel.app/blog/pagely#features-).
