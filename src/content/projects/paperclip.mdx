I often found myself switching between different apps and websites such as Notion, Todoist, Trello, Excalidraw, Codepen and many more.
I wanted to create a single place to store all my notes, code snippets, and other stuff. And that's the reason I created Paperclip.

I was able to complete it in under a month. Thanks to the [Hashnode Auth0 hackathon](https://townhall.hashnode.com/auth0-hackathon).  
Although I was not the winner or runner, It was a nice experience and got to learn a lot.

## Features

- A powerful note taking experience with almost all features of Notion
- Watch Youtube videos while writing notes
- Incredibly fast Command Palette
- Sticky notes to quickly jot down important notes
- A Pomorodo timer that rewards you with a point every time you complete a session!
- A lightning fast HTML-CSS-JS playground for awesome frontend devs
- Good ol' todolists
