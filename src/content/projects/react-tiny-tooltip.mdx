I built this library to make building tooltips in react a breeze. It is a small, opinionated library that is easy to use and easy to understand.

I built this tooltip component while building [Paperclip](/projects/paperclip). I liked it and wanted to reuse it in all my other projects.
So I ended up building this library.

You can view a blog post about this library [here](/blog/react-tiny-tooltip).

This is the code you need to build an accessible, styled, simple, powerful tooltip in react.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Tooltip } from 'react-tiny-tooltip';

export default () => (
  <div>
    <Tooltip content='Hello there' side='top'>
      <button>Hover here!</button>
    </Tooltip>
  </div>
);
```
