## Highlights

This was my first full stack project that I built for the [HarperDB Hashnode Hackathon](https://townhall.hashnode.com/announcing-harperdb-hackathon-on-hashnode).  
I also used many new technologies for making StaticShield such as Typescript and Auth0

## Problem it solves

Password protecting any website is really painful, some of the important features of a password protected website are:

- User will not have to enter the password to view the website again and again
- **Rate limiting** the login attempts.
- **Password should be stored in a secure way** and not in plain text
- **Blocking the logins** to the site temporarily
- Asking the user to enter the password again after a certain time

## Blog

[Here's](/posts/staticshield) a detailed blog that I wrote which goes
through the process of making it
