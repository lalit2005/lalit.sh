import YtEmbed from "../../components/blog/YtEmbed";

I built this for my first offline hackathon which was conducted by iNeuron (now acquired by PW Skills) in
collaboration with GitHub.

It was a 24 hour hackathon, so it just has the bare minimum features and I did not find time after the
hackathon to work on this project.

I'm glad that this project was able to win the 3rd prize in hackathon.

See [this page](/more/ineuron-hackathon) for more clips from the hackathon

Here's me, showing the demo:
