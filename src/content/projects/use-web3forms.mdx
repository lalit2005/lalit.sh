This was my first open source NPM package. It is a simple library that makes form submission easier with the help of [Web3forms](https://web3forms.com).  
I built it to reduce the boilerplate code required to submit a form.

I learnt about **managing releases** and publishing packages on NPM and Yarn.  
Moreover, I dived deep into **javascript bundlers**. I tried a handful of them such as _Rollup_, _esbuild_, [bunchee](https://github.com/huozhi/bunchee) and [microbundle](https://github.com/developit/microbundle).

I finally came down to microbundle as it required no configuration and was beginner friendly too. (bunchee too requires no configuration!!)

I found out about microbundle from [Paco Coursey](https://twitter.com/pacocoursey)'s `next-themes` [package](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes).

Here's how you you would use it with typescript:

```tsx
interface FormData {
  hello: string;
  isWorking: boolean | "Probably";
}

const { submit } = useWeb3forms<FormData>({
  apikey: "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE",
  onSuccess: (successMessage, data) => {
    console.log(successMessage, data);
  },
  onError: (errorMessage, data) => {
    console.log(errorMessage, data);
  },
});

// Submitting the form
<button
  onClick={(e) => {
    submit({
      hello: "world",
      isWorking: "Yesss!!!",
    });
  }}
>
  Submit form
</button>;
```

> `use-web3forms` is only about \<500 bytes.
